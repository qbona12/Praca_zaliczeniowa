# Summary

![](photo2.png)

Throughout this thesis, we have examined efficient communication tactics for remote and distributed teams. Initially, we offered an overview of the issue, highlighting the concept of remote and dispersed teams and emphasising the need for efficient communication in these circumstances. The problem overview chapter examined current research on remote and dispersed teams, identifying gaps in the field that need to be filled.

This thesis established the foundation for understanding successful communication techniques for remote and distributed teams. It may serves as a basis for future research and practical application by filling gaps in existing research and giving insights into problems and best practices. As organisationsÂ adopt remote and distributed work models, it is critical to adjust communication methods to optimise cooperation and achieve success in these dynamic and developing work settings.
